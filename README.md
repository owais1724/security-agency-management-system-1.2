# SAMS | Security Agency Management System


**SAMS (Security Agency Management System)** is a production-grade, multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to streamline operations for security agencies. It provides a robust, secure, and premium experience for managing personnel, clients, projects, attendance, and payroll.

## 🚀 Vision & Key Features

SAMS is built with three core pillars: **Security**, **Scalability**, and **Simplicity**.

### 🔐 Advanced Multi-Tenancy & Security
- **Portal Isolation**: Dedicated login portals for Super Admins, Agency Admins, and Operational Staff.
- **Tenant Data Shield**: Strict `agencyId` scoping at the database and API level ensures cross-agency data leaks are impossible.
- **Hierarchical RBAC**: Granular permission system based on designations (Guard, Supervisor, HR, etc.).

### 🏢 Agency Administration
- **Personnel Onboarding**: Simplified staff registration with automatic role assignment.
- **Client & Project Management**: Manage institutional contracts and link them to operational sites.
- **Dynamic RBAC Dashboard**: Real-time permission mapping for agency-specific roles.

### 📅 Operational Excellence
- **Attendance System**: Project-locked check-in/out with multi-method support.
- **Intelligent Leave Management**: 
  - Hierarchical approval flow (Supervisor → HR → Admin).
  - **Emergency Flow**: Automatic approval with post-action audit acceptance.
  - **Dynamic Skipping**: System automatically redirects requests if an approver is on leave.

### 💰 Financial Management
- **Payroll Engine**: Generate bulk or individual payroll records with automated net pay calculations.
- **Audit Trails**: Critical actions are logged with severity levels for compliance and transparency.

## 🛡 Security Architecture

SAMS utilizes a **Bulletproof API Interceptor** layer to handle authentication:
- **Auto-Dismissal**: Previous error states are cleared instantly upon new attempts.
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Explicit token handoff during login sequences.
- **Session Protection**: Automatic global logout and token purging on 401 Unauthorized detection.
